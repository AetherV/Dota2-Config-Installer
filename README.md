# AetherV's Dota2-Config-Installer
## As of Vulcan Patch, this project is put on hold, since Valve removed the ability to make productive autoexecs. Once this patch is reversed, I shall continue supporting this project. Until then, this project is on hold. 

## What is This?
Installer for @Loopuleasa's Dota2-TheCore-Config-Engine. This will automate the installation procedure.


## Requires

- Java
- Windows (Should be multiplatform, but yet to try)


## What It Does

1.  Downloads the Config from Loopulesa's Page
2.  Allows you to select which configs to install
3.  Automatic Installation Process, only requires user to select Dota2 Installation Folder

Now allows the installation of Manta Configurations


## Things to-do

- Implement Config Uninstall
- Remove Temp Files 


## How To Use:

### In Windows (should be similar on other platforms)
1.  Download: - https://github.com/AetherV/Dota2-Config-Installer/blob/master/Compiled/16-5-25%20Dota2%20Conig%20Installer.jar?raw=true
2.  (If Needed) Install Java
3.  Run Jar File (double click will do in most cases)
4.  Locate the "dota 2 beta folder", typically at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta"
5.  Choose your desired config (9/10 Cases you will want "Loopuleasa's Super Compact QWERTG-DFXCV Layout")
6.  Press Install
  
### In Dota2:
1.  Enable the Console 
2.  Before the match begins, type in "exec loop.cfg", "exec tab.cfg" or "exec core.cfg" depending on which version you wish to use
